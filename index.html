						Hi there! I'm an 18-year-old who loves meeting new people and socializing. Family and sports take a big part in my life, and I really enjoy spending time with them. I think building strong connections with others is really important, and my family and teammates are very important to me. Right now, I'm studying hard at ESSEC Business School to pursue my goals and learn as much as I can. I'm excited to see what the future holds! </p>

				<h2><strong>Football</strong></h2>
					<p>Football is one of my favorite hobbies! I love getting together with my teammates and working on our skills. Not only is it a great way to stay active, but it's also a great opportunity to build strong connections with others. Whether we're playing a game or just practicing, I always have a great time on the field.</p>

				<h2><strong>Gym</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Going to the gym is another hobby I really enjoy. I like the challenge of pushing myself to lift heavier weights or run faster on the treadmill. It's a great way to relieve stress and improve my overall health and fitness. Plus, I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a series or catch up on the latest releases!

				<h2><strong>Mangas</strong></h2>
					<p>One of my favorite hobbies is reading manga. I love exploring the worlds and characters created by different artists and writers. Whether I'm following the adventures of my favorite heroes or discovering new stories, there's always something exciting to read. I find reading manga to be a great way to unwind and escape from reality for a little while. Plus, I always feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a series or catch up on the latest releases!</p>
